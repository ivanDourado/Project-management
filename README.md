# 📅 Project Management Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard was developed to provide a comprehensive overview of multiple construction and implementation projects. The data was extracted from **Microsoft Project (`.mpp`)** and **Access (`.mdb`)** files representing different phases and areas of a larger operational initiative.

## 📁 Project Files Used

- `Bomba de Gasolina.mpp / .mdb`: Timeline and resources related to the installation of fuel pumps
- `Construcao do Estacionamento.mpp / .mdb`: Schedule and cost details for parking lot construction
- `Instalacao dos Equipamentos.mpp / .mdb`: Tasks and dependencies for equipment deployment
- `Normas de Seguranca.mpp / .mdb`: Compliance and safety-related project deliverables

## 🎯 Objectives

- Track the status and progress of each project phase  
- Identify delays and resource bottlenecks  
- Ensure compliance with safety deadlines and standards  
- Support decision-making through centralized visual reporting  
- Monitor workload and milestone achievements

## 📊 Key Metrics

- ✅ **% Completion by Project and Task**  
- ⌛ **Planned vs. Actual Duration**  
- 💰 **Estimated vs. Actual Cost per Project**  
- 🧑‍💼 **Workload by Team / Resource**  
- 📆 **Milestone Tracking (Start and End Dates)**  
- 🔄 **Critical Path and Dependencies**

## 📌 Dashboard Features

- Overview tab with aggregated KPIs for all projects  
- Filters by project name, phase, task owner, and status  
- Gantt-style visuals with dynamic time range  
- Color-coded task status (On Time, Delayed, Completed)  
- Drill-down into specific project stages for detailed tracking

## 🧠 Insights Extracted

- The *Fuel Pump Installation* project is currently **15% behind schedule**, mostly due to delays in equipment delivery.  
- The *Parking Lot Construction* phase has a **cost overrun of 8%**, primarily in labor-related activities.  
- *Safety Compliance* tasks are progressing well, with **90% of deliverables already completed** and within timeline.  
- Team members assigned to both *Equipment Installation* and *Fuel Pump* projects are **overallocated**, suggesting resource conflicts.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Microsoft Project**: Original project scheduling and planning  
- **Microsoft Access**: Task and resource databases  
- **Power BI Desktop**: Dashboard creation and DAX modeling  
- **DAX**: To calculate metrics like completion %, delay days, and cumulative cost
